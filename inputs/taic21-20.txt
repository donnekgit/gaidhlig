When I leave the church, I'll be going straight home.

Mar a thèid thu seachad air a' bhùth, chi thu a' phàirc.
As you pass the shop, you can see the park.

Ma chuireas tu dhìot do chòta cha bhi thu cho blàth.
If you take off your coat you'll not be so warm.

On a ruigeas sinn am baile ro mheadhan-là bidh mi a' dol dhan taigh-òsta airson dìnnear.
Since we'll arrive in town before midday I'll be going to the hotel for dinner.

Bidh a' chaileag a choinnicheas tu na seasamh le ròs na làimh.
The girl who will meet you will be standing with a rose in her hand.

Ma bhitheas an oidhche fuar fuirich a-staigh.
If the night will be cold stay inside.

Bidh mi ag obair anns an taigh-òsta sin nuair a dh'fhàgas mi an sgoil.
I will be working in that hotel when I leave school.

Bheir mi mìlseag dhut ma bheir thu pòg dhomh.
I'll give you a sweet if you will give me a kiss.

Ach am bith thu toilichte leis na tha agad?
But will you be happy with all that you'll have?

Bhiodh e a' cluich anns a' phàirc.
He would be playing in the park.

Bhiodh e a' cluich anns a' phàirc a h-uile là
He played in the park every day.

Tha e ag ràdh gum buaileadh e.
He says that he would strike.

Tha e ag ràdh gum fàgadh e.
He says that he would leave.

Tha e ag ràdh nach fhàgadh e.

Is mise a bhuaileadh e.
It is I who would hit him.

Is esan a bhuaileadh mi.
It is he who would hit me.

Is mise nach fhàgadh thu.
It is I who would not leave you.

Is mise nach fhàgadh tu.
It is I who you would not leave.

Seo leabhar a leughainn.
Here's a book I would read.

Agus seo leabhar nach leughainn.
And here's a book I would not read.

Dè thogadh tu air an talamh?
What would you build on the land?

Cò sgrìobhadh litir thugam?
Who would write me letter?

Carson a bhuaileadh tu am balach?
Why would you hit the boy?

Ciamar a sheasadh i?
How would she stand?

Cuin a dh'fhàgadh tu?
When would you leave?

Càit an òladh iad?
Where would they drink?

Bhithinn toilichte nam fàgadh tu.
I would be happy if you would leave.

Bhiodh i as aonais mus òladh i an t-uisge salach.
She would be without before she would drink the dirty water.

Bhiodh tu duilich nan togadh tu taigh an sin.
You would sorry if you built a house there.

Nan robh an t-airgead agam, thogainn taigh ùr.
If I had the money, I would build a new house.

An sgrìobhadh tu litir thugam?
Would you write me a letter?

Nach òladh tu am bainne?
Would you not drink the milk?

Ghabhadh e bracaist a h-uile madainn.
He took breakfast ever morning.

Sgrìobhamaid litir thuige a h-uile là
We wrote him a letter every day.

Tha fios agamsa far an seasainn.
I know where I would stand.

An sgrìobhadh tu d' ainm dhomhsa?
Could you write your name for me?

Dh'fhàgadh e an taigh sin a-màireach.
He would leave the house tomorrow.

Thuirt mi nach bruidhninn riutha a-rithist.
I said that I wouldn't speak to them again.

Bha fios aice nach ruitheadh e air falbh.
She knew that he wouldn't run away.

Dè a sgrìobhadh sibh anns an litir?
What would you write in the letter?

Cha choisichinn dhachaigh anns an dorchadas.
I wouldn't walk home in the dark.

Shaoil i gun tilleadh iad ro mheadhan-là
She thought that they would return before midday.

An ceannaicheadh tu an taigh sin? Cheannaicheadh.
Would you buy that house? Yes.

Cha do shaoil thu gun glacadh tu iasg anns an loch sin?
You didn't think that you would catch any fish in that loch?

Chan fhuirichinn ann an Glaschu idir.
I wouldn't stay in Glasgow at all.

Thuirt e gun reiceadh e an càr aige a-màireach.
He said he would sell his car tomorrow.

An atharraicheadh sibh càil anns an rùm? Chan atharraicheadh.
Would you change anything in the room? No.

Chan òladh i càil ach uisge glan.
She wouldn't drink anything but fresh water.

Cha diùltainn gun robh e a' coimhead ciontach.
I wouldn't deny that he was looking guilty.

Thuirt i gun sgrìobhadh i litir gun phàipear naidheachd.
She said she would write a letter to the newspaper.

Bha dòchas aca gun obraicheadh a h-uile rud gu ceart.
They hoped that everything would work correctly.

Chan chanainn gun robh i bòidheach.
I wouldn't say she was pretty.

Chan òlainn a-riamh a-mach à botal.
I would never drink out of a bottle.

Dh'innis e dhomh gun loisgeadh e na pàipearan.
He told me he would burn the papers.

Cha ghabhadh i airgead bho choigreach.
She wouldn't accept money from a stranger.

Càit an togadh sibh ur taigh ùr?
Where would you build your new house?

Thuirt i gum faigheadh i briosgaid.
She said that she would get a biscuit.

Thuirt i nach fhaigheadh e briosgaid.
She said that he would not get a biscuit.

Shaoil esan gun tigeadh e a-màireach.
He thought that he would come tomorrow.

Chreid mi nach tigeadh e.
I believed that he would not come.

Is mise a chìtheadh an solas agus is tusa nach fhaiceadh.
It's me who could see and you who could not.

Is i Màiri a thigeadh mura robh droch shìde ann.
It's Màiri who would come unless there was bad weather.

Dè gheibhinn do mo mhàthair?
What could I get for my mother?

Cò bheireadh dhomh freagairt?
Who could give me an answer?

Carson a theireadh tu a leithid de rud?
Why would you say such a thing?

Ciamar a dh'fhaighinn lethbhreac?
How could I get a copy?

Cuin a chìtheadh tu a-rithist e?
When would you see him again?

Càit am faighinn lethbhreac?
Where could I get a copy?

Thigeadh e nan tigeadh sibh.
He would come if you would.

Cha bhiodh i toilichte mura faigheamaid dhachaigh.
She wouldn't be happy if we couldn't get home.

Cha dhèanainn sin mus faigheadh tu-fhèin cothrom.
I wouldn't do that before you got a chance.

Thuirt e gun tigeadh e dhan chèilidh a-nochd.
He said he would come to the ceilidh tonight.

Tha mi cinnteach gun dèanadh iad sin.
I'm sure they would do that.

Dh'innis mi dhaibh nach fhaiceadh iad a' choille bhon uinneig aca.
I told them they wouldn't see the forest from their window.

Cha robh fios agam na theirinn riutha.
I didn't know what I would say to them.

An toireadh sibh cobhair dhan fhear sin? Bheireadh.
Would you give some help to that man? Yes.

Is mise a dhèanadh an dìnnear.
It's me who would make dinner.

Thuirt iad gun ruigeadh iad am baile ann an ùine ghoirid.
They said they would reach the town in a short while.

Bha i an dòchas gum faigheadh i airgead bho a caraid.
She was hoping that she would get some money from her friend.

Thuirt mi gun cluinninn iad a' cluich a-muigh.
I said that I could hear them playing outside.

Thuirt iad nach rachadh iad a-mach ann am bàta.
They said that they wouldn't go out in a boat.

Cha tigeadh i leam dhan chuirm-chiùil.
She wouldn't come with me to the concert.

Tha fios agam nach dèanadh iad a leithid de rud.
I know that they wouldn't do such a thing.

Tha mi cinnteach gum beirinn orra mus ruigeadh iad an geata.
I am sure I would catch them before they would reach the gate.

'S ann air an dùthaich a chluinneadh sibh uiseag a' seinn.
It's in the country that you would hear the skylark singing.

Cuin a dhèanadh tu an obair?
When would you do the job?

Ruigeadh iad an t-eilean ron mhadainn.
They would reach the island before morning.

Thuirt duine nach fhaigheadh i a h-airgead air ais.
Someone said that she would not get her money back.

Cha toirinn dhut sgillinn airson càr mar sin.
I wouldn't give you a penny for a car like that.

Carson nach rachadh sibh leam?
Why would you not go with me?

Carson nach rachadh sibh còmhla rium?
Why would you not go with me?

An abaireadh tu gun robh e eireachdail?
Would you say that he was handsome?
